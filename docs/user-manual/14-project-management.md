# Project Management (PPM)

**Audience:** Project managers, planners, project accountants · **Required role/permission:** any of
`exec` / `planner` / `ar` (the win/loss dashboard also opens for `crm`). · **Process narrative:**
`docs/process-narratives/16-project-accounting.md` · **Design/roadmap:** `docs/19-project-management-ppm-plan.md`.

The Project Management workspace turns the project ledger into a full operational PPM experience —
work breakdown, schedule/Gantt, resourcing, earned value, and a sales win/loss dashboard whose won
deals convert into projects.

## Where to find it
- **Projects** — sidebar **วางแผน & BI → โครงการ (Projects)** (`/projects`).
- **Win/Loss Pipeline** — sidebar **วางแผน & BI → ไปป์ไลน์ Win/Loss** (`/projects/pipeline`), or the
  **Win/Loss** button on the Projects page.

## Projects register (`/projects`)
The KPI band shows project count, unbilled WIP, cumulative billed, and cumulative margin. The table lists
every project with cost, budget usage (amber ≥ 85%, red ⚠ over budget), billed %, WIP and margin.
- **Create a project** — fill the form (name, optional code, customer, T&M or Fixed, contract value) → *สร้าง*.
- **Open a project** — click any row to open its workspace.
- **Quick actions** — the clock (log cost) and receipt (bill) icons on a row open those dialogs without leaving the list.

## Project workspace (`/projects/{code}`)
Tabbed, deep-linkable (`?tab=`):
- **ภาพรวม (Overview)** — % complete, **CPI** (cost) and **SPI** (schedule) health tiles (green ≥ 1, amber
  ≥ 0.9, red below), cumulative margin/WIP; an **S-curve** of planned cost vs the current EV/AC; and the
  full earned-value breakdown (BAC/PV/EV/AC/CV/SV/EAC).
- **กำหนดการ & Gantt (Schedule)** — a dependency-aware **Gantt** with the **critical path** highlighted in
  the primary colour and an inner fill for % complete, plus the WBS table. **เพิ่มงาน** adds a task (hours,
  budget, dates, % and you may set predecessors); the check icon marks a task done (→ 100%).
- **หมุดหมาย (Milestones)** — add milestones; the flag icon marks one **reached**. A milestone with a
  *วางบิล %* raises that Fixed-price progress bill automatically when reached.
- **ทรัพยากร (Resources)** — assign people (the cost/bill rate is pulled from the rate card by role);
  over-allocation across projects is flagged in the capacity report.
- **ต้นทุน & บิล (Costs & bill)** — the cost-entry ledger with the posting JE, plus *ลงต้นทุน* / *วางบิล* dialogs.

## Win/Loss pipeline dashboard (`/projects/pipeline`)
Win rate, weighted forecast, won and lost value; a **pipeline-by-stage** funnel; **loss reasons**; a
**monthly win-rate** trend; and a **by-owner** league table with each rep's win rate. A won opportunity can
be converted into a project from the CRM pipeline (control **CRM-WL**).

## Control callouts
- Billing (incl. milestone billing) is segregated from cost initiation (**R07**) and capped at the contract
  value — see the troubleshooting list for `BILL_EXCEEDS_CONTRACT`, `OPP_NOT_WON`, `SOD_SELF_APPROVAL`,
  `BAD_ALLOC`, `BAD_DEPENDENCY`.
- EVM (CPI/SPI) and the critical-path schedule are **detective** signals (**PROJ-06**) — they post nothing.
