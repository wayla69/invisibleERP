## 2. Standard reports (Excel & PDF)

**Required permission:** varies by report (`dashboard` / `pos` / `exec` for sales;
`creditors` / `exec` for AP).

| Report | What it is | Output |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Daily sales** | Sales for a day, by product / method | Excel |
| **Stock summary** | On-hand stock, low-stock highlighted | Excel |
| **Monthly P&L** | Profit & loss for a month | Excel |
| **AP aging** | What you owe suppliers, by age | Excel |
| **Thai tax invoice / receipt** | Compliant PDF documents | PDF |
| **Order export** | A single order | PDF / text |

### To export a report

1. Open the relevant module's report area (e.g. Reports / Finance / POS).
2. Set any parameters (date, month, year).
3. Click **Export** and choose the format (Excel or PDF).

**Expected result:** The file downloads to your computer.

## 3. AI forecasting & replenishment

**Screen:** `/replenishment` (and `/planner`) · **Required permission:** `planner`
(also `dashboard` / `warehouse`).

The system suggests what to reorder based on demand, min/max levels and lead
times.

1. Go to **Replenishment** (`/replenishment`).
2. Review the suggested items, sorted by urgency (critical items flagged).
3. Where offered, **generate a purchase requisition** directly from a suggestion.

**Expected result:** A prioritised reorder list, and optionally a draft PR ready
for [procurement](./03-procurement.md).

## 4. Anomaly detection

**Required permission:** `planner` / `dashboard`.

The analytics engine highlights unusual activity (e.g. sudden cost spikes,
unexpected stock movements) over the recent period.

1. Open the **Anomalies** view (analytics / dashboard area).
2. Review flagged items and investigate.

**Expected result:** A list of unusual events worth a closer look.

---

## 5. Planning & budgeting

**Screen:** `/planning` · **Required permission:** `exec` (create); `approvals`
(approve).

- Create **budget versions** and scenarios.
- Submit a version for approval; an approver activates the baseline.
- View **3-way variance**: Budget vs Forecast vs Actual.

**Expected result:** You can plan, approve and track performance against budget.

## 6. AI assistant (chat)

**Screen:** `/assistant` · **Required permission:** `ai_chat` (also `dashboard`).

Ask questions in plain language and get answers drawn from your live data.

1. Go to **Assistant** (`/assistant`).
2. Type a question, or pick a quick prompt such as *"Summarise today's sales"*
   (**สรุปยอดขายวันนี้**), *"Low-stock items"* (**สินค้าที่สต๊อกต่ำ**) or
   *"Finance KPIs"* (**KPI การเงิน**).
3. Read the reply; it streams in as it is generated.

**Expected result:** A conversational answer with figures from your inventory,
sales, finance and other modules.

> **Note:** The assistant answers from your own tenant's data only and respects
> your permissions.
